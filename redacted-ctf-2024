# The .vcd file is log data from a hardware simulation run,
# Read up on the .vcd file and what it's used for.

# Most of the data, you don't need. But the lines of binary
# are clearly some sort of data entered and processed.
# The binary entries with a trailing " character are apparently
# output ('dout'), so let's use those. Throw everything else away.

# Excerpt:
#   b01010000
#   b01000011
#   b01010100
#   b01000110
#   b01111011
#   b01010010
#   b01010100
#   b01001100
#   b01011111
#   (...)

# From here it's pretty obvious to interpret it as ASCII, which
# Perl can do super quickly, if unfashionably. Make it so...

# Extract only binary outputs, toss junk, pass to Perl convert/print one-liner
# And, voila.
