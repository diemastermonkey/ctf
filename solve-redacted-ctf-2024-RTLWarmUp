# The .vcd file is log data from a hardware simulation run,
# Read up on the .vcd file and what it's used for.

# Most of the file, we don't need, though its interesting.
# But the lines of binary are clearly data entered and processed.
# The binary entries with a trailing " character are apparently
# output ('dout', in the file), so let's look at those. Toss everything else.

# Excerpt:
#   b01010000
#   b01000011
#   b01010100
#   b01000110
#   b01111011
#   b01010010
#   b01010100
#   b01001100
#   b01011111
#   (...)

# From here it's pretty obvious to interpret it as ASCII, which
# Perl can do super quickly, if unfashionably. Make it so!

# Extract only binary outputs, toss junk, pass to Perl convert/print one-liner

cat flag.vcd | egrep "^b.*\"" | sed 's/ "//g' | perl -ne 'print chr(oct($_))'

# And, voila.
